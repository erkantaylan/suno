LYRICS:

```
[Intro: 8 bars - Hurdy-gurdy drone building with rising synth tension]\

[Verse 1: Lute arpeggios layered with pulsing 808 bass, whispered male vocals]\
In the halls where shadows creep \
Where Aldric guards the secrets deep \
Stone walls hum with electric streams \
Ancient power feeds the machine \
Through the fog of centuries passed \
Iron gears spin cold and fast \
Seraphine calls from the tower high \
Her voice cuts through the neon sky \

[Pre-Chorus: Hammered dulcimer melody over building synth layers]\
We're lost between the old and new \
Where torchlight bleeds to laser hue \
The kingdom runs on coded dreams \
Nothing here is what it seems \

[Chorus: Full drop - Fiddle hooks with distorted bass, epic chanting]\
Castle in the machine! \
Where the past and future collide \
Castle in the machine! \
There's no place left to hide \
We dance on hallowed ground tonight \
Medieval souls in digital light \
Castle in the machine! \
We're alive, we're alive, we're alive \

[Post-Chorus: 4 bars - Fiddle breakdown with glitchy percussion]\

[Verse 2: Rebec melody with driving techno beat, breathy female vocals]\
Seraphine walks the circuit throne \
Her heart is flesh, her crown is chrome \
Aldric kneels with sword in hand \
A knight who serves at her command \
The moat is filled with liquid gold \
Data streams a thousand years old \
The drawbridge falls to bass so deep \
The kingdom wakes—the kingdom weeps \

[Pre-Chorus: Psaltery shimmer with ethereal harmonies]\
We're lost between the old and new \
Where torchlight bleeds to laser hue \
The kingdom runs on coded dreams \
Nothing here is what it seems \

[Chorus: Full drop with additional vocal layers]\
Castle in the machine! \
Where the past and future collide \
Castle in the machine! \
There's no place left to hide \
We dance on hallowed ground tonight \
Medieval souls in digital light \
Castle in the machine! \
We're alive, we're alive, we're alive \

[Bridge: Stripped back - Solo lute with distant synth pads, spoken word]\
One thousand years of stone and steel \
Now circuits pulse with what we feel \
The tapestries tell tales in code \
As Aldric walks the endless road \
Seraphine whispers through the wire \
Her ancient heart, a digital fire \

[Build-up: 8 bars - Hurdy-gurdy crescendo with rising white noise and snare rolls]\

[Final Chorus: Maximum intensity - All instruments, layered vocals, epic finale]\
Castle in the machine! \
Where the past and future collide \
Castle in the machine! \
There's no place left to hide \
We dance on hallowed ground tonight \
Medieval souls in digital light \
Castle in the machine! \
WE'RE ALIVE! WE'RE ALIVE! WE'RE ALIVE! \

[Outro: 8 bars - Fading lute melody with distant electronic echoes, whispered:]\
The machine remembers... \
The castle stands... \
Forever... \
```
