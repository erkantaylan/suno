SONG NAME: Report My Team

---

[Intro: Distorted Bass Drop, Keyboard Clicks SFX]\

[Verse 1: Aggressive Rap-Rock, Pounding Drums]\
Polse queues up at 3 AM again\
Five thousand hours deep, still stuck in the den\
Fives griefing lanes like it's his full-time job\
Running down mid, making the whole team sob\

First blood on mid, Slam dies to creeps\
"It's not my fault!" while the whole team weeps\
Pinged the missing call, they ignored the sign\
Now Spectre's in our base at minute nine\

[Pre-Chorus: Building Tension, Double Kick Drums]\
Check the scoreboard, zero and fifteen\
Slam still blaming, same old routine\

[Chorus: Full Rage, Screaming Vocals, Heavy Breakdown]\
REPORT MY TEAM\
They're throwing every single game\
REPORT MY TEAM\
I'm losing my mind, going insane\
Every match the same disaster\
Climbing ranks but falling faster\
REPORT MY TEAM\

[Verse 2: Aggressive, Rhythmic Riffs]\
Erkan locks in Meepo, here we go again\
Zero micro, feeding kills like it's a trend\
Five little Meepos running different ways\
"I'm practicing bro" yeah for thirty days\

Fives bought the wards and planted them at base\
Slam keeps diving with a straight poker face\
"Team diff" he types while he's one and ten\
Queue pops up, here we go again\

[Pre-Chorus: Building Tension, Double Kick Drums]\
Ancient's dying, throne's on fire\
Erkan's Meepos made it even more dire\

[Chorus: Full Rage, Screaming Vocals, Heavy Breakdown]\
REPORT MY TEAM\
They're throwing every single game\
REPORT MY TEAM\
I'm losing my mind, going insane\
Every match the same disaster\
Climbing ranks but falling faster\
REPORT MY TEAM\

[Bridge: Spoken Word Over Distorted Ambience]\
"Why do I even play with these guys anymore?\
Fives is griefing, Slam won't admit he's feeding,\
And Erkan... bro... put down the Meepo.\
I'm done. I'm actually done."\

[Breakdown: Maximum Aggression, Mosh Pit Energy]\
FIVES IS GRIEFING\
SLAM WON'T LEARN\
ERKAN'S MEEPOS\
CRASH AND BURN\
POLSE IS TILTED\
QUEUE AGAIN\
WHY ARE WE FRIENDS\
WE MUST BE INSANE\

[Final Chorus: Explosive, All Out Chaos]\
REPORT MY TEAM\
They're throwing every single game\
REPORT MY TEAM\
I'm losing my mind, going insane\
Every match the same disaster\
Climbing ranks but falling faster\
REPORT MY TEAM\
REPORT MY TEAM\

[Outro: Defeat Sound Effect, Mouse Click, Queue Pop Sound]\
...Searching for match...\
...Fives has joined the party...\
