SONG NAME: Report My Team

---

[Intro: Ominous Synth Drone, Distant Thunder, Evil Choir Hum]\

[Verse 1: Deep Menacing Vocals, Slow Pounding Bass]\
Polse sits in darkness, screen glowing bright\
Five thousand hours wasted, another cursed night\
Fives joins the lobby with that wicked grin\
The griefing starts before the game begins\

The ancient trembles, shadows start to creep\
Slam feeds first blood, pretends he's half asleep\
"Not my fault" he whispers through the void\
Another soul corrupted, another game destroyed\

[Pre-Chorus: Building Dread, Low Strings]\
The scoreboard tells a tale of doom\
Five dead heroes, sealed their tomb\

[Chorus: Dark Choir, Theatrical Evil, Grand]\
Report my team\
They've sold their souls for MMR dreams\
Report my team\
Nothing is ever what it seems\
In the depths of ranked we fall\
Answering the abyss's call\
Report my team\

[Verse 2: Calculated Menace, Haunting Melody]\
Erkan summons Meepo from the depths below\
Five little demons with nowhere to go\
Scattered across the map like cursed remains\
Feeding the enemy, eternal chains\

Fives plants a ward inside our sacred ground\
Then walks to mid without a single sound\
A saboteur dressed as a friend\
Watching our rating descend\

[Pre-Chorus: Building Dread, Low Strings]\
The throne is burning, hope is thin\
Erkan's Meepos seal our sin\

[Chorus: Dark Choir, Theatrical Evil, Grand]\
Report my team\
They've sold their souls for MMR dreams\
Report my team\
Nothing is ever what it seems\
In the depths of ranked we fall\
Answering the abyss's call\
Report my team\

[Bridge: Whispered, Creeping Dread]\
Why do I return to this cursed game?\
Fives... Slam... Erkan... always the same\
We are bound together by this endless pain\
Matched by fate... again... and again...\

[Dark Chant: Slow, Ritualistic]\
Fives... the betrayer\
Slam... the denier\
Erkan... the summoner\
Polse... the survivor\

[Final Chorus: Full Orchestral Evil, Triumphant Darkness]\
Report my team\
They've sold their souls for MMR dreams\
Report my team\
Nothing is ever what it seems\
In the depths of ranked we fall\
Answering the abyss's call\
Report my team\
Report my team\

[Outro: Queue Sound Echoing Into Void, Evil Laugh Fade]\
...The queue calls once more...\
