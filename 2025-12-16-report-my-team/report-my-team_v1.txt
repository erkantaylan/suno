SONG NAME: Report My Team

---

[Intro: Distorted Bass Drop, Keyboard Clicks SFX]\

[Verse 1: Aggressive Rap-Rock, Pounding Drums]\
Dmitri queues up at 3 AM again\
Five thousand hours deep, still stuck in the den\
Last pick goes carry when we needed support\
Jungle Pudge on my team, mental's getting short\

First blood on mid, Razor dies to creeps\
Chen's disconnected, my MMR weeps\
Pinged the missing call, they ignored the sign\
Now Spectre's in our base at minute nine\

[Pre-Chorus: Building Tension, Double Kick Drums]\
Check the scoreboard, zero and fifteen\
This is the nightmare, this is the dream\

[Chorus: Full Rage, Screaming Vocals, Heavy Breakdown]\
REPORT MY TEAM\
They're throwing every single game\
REPORT MY TEAM\
I'm losing my mind, going insane\
Every match the same disaster\
Climbing ranks but falling faster\
REPORT MY TEAM\

[Verse 2: Aggressive, Rhythmic Riffs]\
Magnus missed the RP on five of them standing still\
Morphling went full strength, zero concept of skill\
Yuki's playing Techies in a ranked game tonight\
Started flaming at the draft, now the whole chat's in a fight\

"GG end fast" at minute two\
Courier feeding, nothing new\
I pinged the Roshan pit, they farmed the woods\
Would uninstall if I only could\

[Pre-Chorus: Building Tension, Double Kick Drums]\
Ancient's dying, throne's on fire\
This is hell, it can't get dire\

[Chorus: Full Rage, Screaming Vocals, Heavy Breakdown]\
REPORT MY TEAM\
They're throwing every single game\
REPORT MY TEAM\
I'm losing my mind, going insane\
Every match the same disaster\
Climbing ranks but falling faster\
REPORT MY TEAM\

[Bridge: Spoken Word Over Distorted Ambience]\
"Why do I even play this game anymore?\
Six thousand behavior score... and these are my teammates?\
I'm done. I'm actually done."\

[Breakdown: Maximum Aggression, Mosh Pit Energy]\
ONE MORE GAME\
ONE MORE LOSS\
ONE MORE GAME\
SANITY'S COST\
QUEUE AGAIN\
NEVER LEARN\
WATCH THE ANCIENT\
CRASH AND BURN\

[Final Chorus: Explosive, All Out Chaos]\
REPORT MY TEAM\
They're throwing every single game\
REPORT MY TEAM\
I'm losing my mind, going insane\
Every match the same disaster\
Climbing ranks but falling faster\
REPORT MY TEAM\
REPORT MY TEAM\

[Outro: Defeat Sound Effect, Mouse Click, Queue Pop Sound]\
...Searching for match...\
