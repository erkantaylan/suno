## 💡 Tips for Better Prompts

1. **Be Specific** – "Acoustic guitar fingerpicking" works better than just "guitar"
2. **Use Adjectives** – Describe the feeling: dreamy, aggressive, warm, crisp
3. **Reference Eras** – "70s funk" or "modern trap" helps set the style
4. **Layer Descriptors** – Combine multiple elements for unique results
5. **Experiment** – Same prompt can yield different results; iterate!
