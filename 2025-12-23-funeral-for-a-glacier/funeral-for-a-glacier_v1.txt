NOTES:
- Characters: Theodore (ancient observer), Celestine (the glacier personified)
- Concept: A song so slow that listening to it feels like continental drift
- Goal: Make Suno generate something that tests the absolute minimum tempo limit
- This song should feel like watching paint dry on a frozen wall in slow motion
- If played at 0.5x speed, it should still feel too fast
- The listener should age visibly while listening
