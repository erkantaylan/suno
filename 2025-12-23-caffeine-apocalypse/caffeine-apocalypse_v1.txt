LYRICS:

```
[Intro: 0.3 seconds - All instruments hit at once like a musical car crash]\

[Verse 1: Speedcore blast beats with auto-tuned screaming, 300 BPM]\
XIOMARA DRANK SEVENTEEN ESPRESSOS \
NOW THE WALLS ARE BREATHING COLORS \
RAGNVALD IS A SENTIENT PIZZA \
NOTHING MAKES SENSE ANYMORE \

[Genre Switch: Suddenly polka for exactly 2 seconds]\
Oompah oompah HERE WE GO \

[Chorus: Hyperpop meets death metal, chipmunk vocals with blast beats]\
CAFFEEEEEINE APOCALYYYYYPSE \
MY NEURONS ARE ON FIIIIIIIRE \
BAGPIPES DUBSTEP KAZOO TIME \
*random goat scream* \
GENRE? WHAT GENRE? ALL GENRES! \

[Breakdown: Mariachi horns over industrial noise]\
XIOMARA SEES THROUGH TIME NOW \
RAGNVALD BECAME A CONCEPT \
THE UNIVERSE IS A FLAT CIRCLE \
MADE OF DRUM AND BASS \

[Bridge: Mongolian throat singing at 250 BPM with chiptune arpeggios]\
brrrrRRRRRRMMMMMMM \
*theremin solo* \
EXISTENCE IS A SPEEDRUN \
WE'RE ALL JUST NPCS \

[Drop: Every instrument plays different songs simultaneously]\
*dubstep wobble* \
*blast beat* \
*yodel* \
*slide whistle glissando* \
*didgeridoo intensifies* \

[Verse 2: Time signature changes every bar - 7/8, 13/16, 5/4, 11/8, √2/π]\
XIOMARA DIVIDED BY ZERO \
THE ANSWER WAS MORE CAFFEINE \
RAGNVALD SPEAKS IN FREQUENCIES \
THAT DOGS CAN BARELY HEAR \

[Chorus 2: Now with added opera soprano screaming over gabber kicks]\
CAFFEEEEEINE APOCALYYYYYPSE \
REALITY HAS LEFT THE CHAT \
WE'RE PLAYING JAZZ BUT WRONG \
ON PURPOSE BUT ALSO BY ACCIDENT \

[Meme Break: Sudden silence for 0.2 seconds, then:]\
...is this loss? \
*EXPLOSION* \

[Outro: Everything at once, 1000 BPM extratone with full orchestra]\
XIOMARA AND RAGNVALD ASCEND \
BEYOND MUSIC BEYOND SOUND \
BEYOND THE CONCEPT OF "SONG" \
WE ARE NOW PURE VIBRATION \
*Windows XP shutdown sound* \
*dial-up internet connecting* \
*microwave beep* \
GOODBYE \
```

NOTES:
- Characters: Xiomara (hyper-caffeinated chaos agent), Ragnvald (transcended pizza entity)
- Concept: What if ADHD was a music genre?
- Goal: Make Suno question its own existence while generating this
- Features: Approximately 47 genre changes, impossible time signatures, and a goat
- If Suno successfully generates this, we've either broken AI or achieved art
- Side effects may include: temporal displacement, spontaneous yodeling, existential revelation
- The √2/π time signature is not a typo, it's a CHALLENGE
