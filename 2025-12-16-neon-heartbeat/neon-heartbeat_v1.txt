SONG NAME: Neon Heartbeat

---

[Intro: Pulsing Synth Arpeggio, Building Tension]\

[Verse 1: Soft Synth Pads, Steady Kick Drum]\
Violet skies above the chrome skyline\
Selene walks alone, chasing the signs\
Electric whispers in the midnight air\
A ghost of who she was is waiting there\

[Pre-Chorus: Rising Synth Strings, Snare Build]\
The city hums a song she used to know\
Before the lights went out and turned to snow\

[Chorus: Full Production, Anthemic, Soaring Vocals]\
Running through the neon heartbeat\
Every pulse is setting her free\
She's alive in the glow tonight\
Burning brighter than satellite lights\
Neon heartbeat\

[Verse 2: Punchy Bass, Rhythmic Arpeggios]\
Viktor's shadow fades in the rearview\
She left that life, nothing left to prove\
The highway stretches like a silver thread\
Tomorrow's waiting miles ahead\

[Pre-Chorus: Rising Synth Strings, Snare Build]\
The radio plays songs from another time\
When love was easy and the future shined\

[Chorus: Full Production, Anthemic, Soaring Vocals]\
Running through the neon heartbeat\
Every pulse is setting her free\
She's alive in the glow tonight\
Burning brighter than satellite lights\
Neon heartbeat\

[Bridge: Stripped Back, Emotional, Synth Solo]\
She's not looking back anymore\
Found the courage she was searching for\
The night is young, the road is long\
This is where she belongs\

[Final Chorus: Maximum Energy, Layered Vocals]\
Running through the neon heartbeat\
Every pulse is setting her free\
She's alive in the glow tonight\
Burning brighter than satellite lights\
Neon heartbeat\
Neon heartbeat\

[Outro: Fading Arpeggios, Soft Synth Wash]\
